# PaleoDarwin
Crosswalking Neotoma &amp; PBDB resources to DarwinCore standards, working w/VertNet

# Project Goals
1) Establish cross-walk between PBDB, Neotoma, and DarwinCore terms.  
2) Identify geochronological fields missing from DarwinCore, set groundwork for an extension.  
3) Migrate PBDB and Neotoma occurrence data to GBIF, via Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT).  
4) Import organic biomarker data into Neotoma (this smay split off to become its own hackathon activity).
